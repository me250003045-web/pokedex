A sleek, responsive Pokédex application built with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. This project fetches real-time data from the PokéAPI to display a collection of Pokémon, their types, physical characteristics, and base stats.

Features:-
Dynamic Gallery: Automatically fetches and displays the first 20 Pokémon from the API.
Search Functionality: Search for any Pokémon by name or its specific ID.
Random Generator: Generates a random Pokémon from the database of all 1025 pokemons.
Detailed Stats: View weight, height, and animated-style base stat bars for specific searches.
Type-Themed Styling: Pokémon cards are color-coded based on their primary elemental type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.).
